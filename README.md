# CRRBinomial

Cox, Ross and Rubinstein (CRR) Binomial Model and Black-Scholes Model implementations. Priced European and American vanilla options, achieving 10<sup>-3</sup> accuracy. Inspiration from original [research paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304405X79900151) and [Quantstart's articles](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/European-vanilla-option-pricing-with-C-and-analytic-formulae) on the subject, but implementations are different and I also looked into American call options as well.


Implemented in both Python and C++ just too look at (obvious) performance tradeoffs and get practice in both languages. Will probably revisit to actually make it adhere to trading industry standards in terms of code construction, e.g. actually use header files in the c++ implementation.

Will upload some graphs and explanations in the future.
